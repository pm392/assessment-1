<h1>Priya's Profile</h1>
<body>
  <h2> Personal Information</h2>
 <body>
   Hello!
   <body>
   <p style="font-size:16px;">
      Since this is a self introduction, and because I find it quite
preposterous to talk about myself in the third person, this shall be in
first person narrative. Moving on from that rather unnecessary small
      talk, let me introduce myself.</p>
  <p style="font-size:16px;">
     I am Priya Mathew, which happens to sound rather bland, considering
my Indian ethnicity and the vast dispossession of names that may
have been.
Currently I am enrolled at RMIT and my student ID is s3925824 and
my email id is: s3925824@student.rmit.edu.au, both of which are
    considerably less conspicuous.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;">
  A regretful downside to having grown up here, along with a severe
case of childhood aversion to individuality, my language skills are
quite disappointing, and as such English is the only language I can
proficiently communicate in. Nonetheless, I wished to carve out my uniqueness amidst my
South- Asian family and so I decided to pursue a degree in Software Engineering…. just like my
dad, my brother and 30 or so of my cousins back in the homeland. That was an adventure
short-lived, and I discontinued after a year into the course and multiple ‘Fails’,But, because of
which, I have had the pleasure of pursuing a variety of different professions. An interesting fact
about me? How could you possibly assume such a thing! Well,why not - I moonlight as a
  thespian- just a rather bad one! I cringe every time.</p>
   </body>
     <h2>   Interest in IT</h2>
  </body>
  <p style="font-size:16px;">
    I have always been curious about how the digital world I so actively participate in, truly works.
Whether it is the social media sites that I check multiple times a day or the dark web, or even
the overlooked simplicity of the text suggestions that pop up as soon as I type in a single letter
into my text box or search engine. I want to learn how lines of code, produced and reiterated
over millions of programmes, can determine so accurately what my political stance may be, just
as well as it can determine my grocery shopping patterns. And since the advent of the
internet,and more recently social media, the digital world has become an irreplaceable part of
our world. I wanted to understand if we can continue to develop and utilise these without the
deeply intrusively and largely unregulated practices of data mining. I want to learn how to make
use of that ever evolving technology to develop less intrusive yet powerful analytical
programmes that can cultivate innovative marketing practices and provide valuable data
    insights.</p>
  <p style= "font-size:16px;">
    I previously worked for a technology giant, and I was fascinated by how the data “voluntarily”
provided by the customers was being used. The data was used to predict purchasing trends,
determine possible flaws in the system or product, and even determine whether a certain fault
was significant enough that it needed to be fixed during the next development phase or it may
be overlooked. I was even more surprised at how much data was constantly collected, and how
thoroughly documented it is, yet how callously it was accessible, and stored indefinitely. And
most often it was used clinically to aid in data modelling and preventing future loss by creating
predictive models with surprising accuracy. This experience has shaped my approach to IT, and
    what cultivated my interest in pursuing IT academically.</p>
  <p style="font-size:16px;">
    I have minimal experience with IT in general. Although through my previous study I have a basic understanding of business information systems, fundamentals of engineering and software & computer programming .However, it has been a while since I pursued academics,and as such I don't retain much of it. And through work I have experience in data entry, basic data analytics, enterprise customer engagement, and some data modelling. </p>
  <p style="font-size:16px;">
    I was particularly interested in RMIT due to the flexibility of online classes and the opportunity to tailor my study timings to what was most convenient for me. I enjoy the ability to autonomously choose how and when I get through the content. I was also interested in how the course was structured with priority given to understanding the course material through assignments rather than a big exam at the end testing one's retention and replication ability more than understanding. </p>
  <p style="font-size:16px;">
    I hope to learn about the various aspects of Information Technology and the different careers that are built from them. I want to build my knowledge on the ethics, impact and applications of IT.  I want to learn, understand and successfully utilise the different tools used in IT, such as the GitHub repository, and other professional platforms. I hope to learn about networking, about the concepts behind the technology such as AI, the benefits of each and I want to develop a more advanced understanding of the trends in IT.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">
My ideal job would be to work as a Customer Engineer for Google, specifically in Cloud Computing. I find this appealing for multiple reasons, firstly because in this role I will get to engage with customers directly and work together with them to deliver solutions specifically addressing their requirements. Also it will give me an opportunity to work in conceptualising the design concept while navigating clients through the different aspects of the cloud.Secondly because I will also be working with the different stakeholders such as the marketing and engineers teams in developing and delivering relevant enhancements to the products following the relevant trends. And lastly because Google is the industry leader in IT, and as such, this experience will bring about opportunities I may not come across otherwise .</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;">
The skills required in order to be considered for this role include a bachelor's degree in a technical field, or significant experience. And it is also a requirement that the candidate possess experience in one of the relevant fields related to cloud computing such as, but not limited to cloud migration, disaster recovery or virtualisation. Also the candidate should have prior experience working as a  technical sales engineer, preferably with expertise in leading cloud campaigns pertaining to migration. With significant skills in  developing a data warehouse, building front and back end platforms, a cloud delivery system or network and experience in writing code in a generally used programming language such as java or python. </p>
<p style="font-size:16px;">
Currently I have some experience and skills in data analytics and working closely with different teams in a large enterprise environment. I have prior experience in cleansing, and analysing data while working with internal and external stakeholders in accurately identifying trends in the relevant market. I have significant exposure in dealing with customers and negotiating and facilitating solutions necessary to their requirements. I am able to communicate effectively and accurately, with  regards to advising the customer about the technical specification of a particular process in a concise and informative manner.</p>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
</body>
<p style="font-size:16px;">
These tests help me better identify what my inherent strengths are and what areas I excel in. The Myers- Briggs test clearly marks as a significant strength of mine being that I possess strong people skills. Another key take away I found while reviewing the Learning Styles Quiz is that I tend to show an equal amount of importance to both the activist style, while also portraying an equal strength  in the reflector style. And thirdly, when I consider the results of the Verbal Reasoning assessment, it indicates that I tend to excel in accurately reviewing verbal data and coming to logical conclusions. Although these tests have provided me with a broad understanding of what may be my key strengths, I find that there is a visible difference in the evaluation of these tests. The Myers- Briggs tests tend to show feelings as a strength of mine however the Verbal Reasoning and the Learning Style quizzes tend to mark me as someone with strong logical reasoning and thinking focused. Also when I take into account previous experiences taking similar personality tests, they have usually given me different personality types. So my overall take away from this, is that they are good for initial gauging of one's skill set, however they are not definitive.</p>
</body>
<h3> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
</body>
<p style="font-size:16px;">
I believe these quizzes have helped influence my views of what key strengths I will bring to a team environment, both in regards to working style and personality type, and as such  it will help me when working collaboratively in a team. For instance the Myers- Briggs test identifies a strong suit of mine being that I am extroverted and this is supported by the Learning Style quiz, which shows that I have strong activist and reflector style approaches.This is something I have previously noticed within myself as a key skills, and something I have over time developed to aid me in collective work environments.  It also indicates that I tend to have a strong inclination to take decisive action,while working inclusively within a team to conceive innovative ideas, and adapt to any change in circumstances easily. While the Verbal Reasoning test marks me to have a strong logical reasoning which will assist me in a group atmosphere where I may be confronted  with conflicting opinions to better identify a sound solution based on the information available.  While also focusing on improving ideas based more on individual assessment.</p>
</body>
<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
</body>
<p style="font-size:16px;">
In regards to forming a team, these assessments have aided me in reflecting about my own work style and form an idea of what may be the most suitable environment where I can contribute best in.I will most likely work well with other individuals who are able to work autonomously with their specific tasks but also are able to contribute to collectively building ideas. And as a person with strong extraversion skills, I believe a team with an equal number of members who are both introverted and extraverted will give a good balance. However, considering the results of my assessments it does indicate that I can be pragmatic and also am someone who can enthusiastically and adapt to a team of individuals of varying personalities.  Although I will prefer to work with other individuals who also possess similar working styles. Yet I do realise that these quizzes are only indicative and not necessarily an accurate analysis of how one may be in a specific circumstance; and as such they hold only a small significance in my review when forming a team.

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
</body>
<h3>Overview</h3>
</body>
<p style="font-size:16px;">
What if we could create an anonymous world, where we are able to access our favourite social media sites without the worry of cookies and trackers constantly observing every keystroke, pause and ad-clicks. (Wired,2021). I wish to develop an App - Freed.OM(Freedom from Online Monitoring) that is able to hide user data when using social media platforms like Facebook and its affiliates. Users who have activated the app are able to browse social media as usual, but the app then creates multiple duplications of the relevant site from various locations globally, that randomly generate activity on the users account, mimicking data usage most common in that localised region, therefore corrupting the accuracy of data and thus rendering it unusable. Thereby, creating an anonymous browsing experience for the end user, without having to sacrifice social interaction. Meanwhile the user’s - real online activity that may be collected through cookies and trackers are simultaneously being erased from the local cache, so it becomes harder for  specific, targeted data collection and monitoring of users.</p>
</body>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
</body>
<p style="font-size:16px;">
The biggest threat for individuals in this Information age is data collection and data mining. specifically the way data is collected, stored and utilized by social media giants such as Facebook and its associated and affiliated technologies(Review.org 2020). 
It has been reported that the Cambridge Analytica Scandal revealed that as many as 87 million people’s data had been harvested.(The New York Times, 2018)
However currently there is no sustainable or feasible alternative besides completely disconnecting, quitting and removing all forms of interactions in the digital world. Yet in order to be an active member of today’s digital society, going off- grid is no longer an option,there is a strong need for a more practical and effective alternative, it has become a necessity of the times.Thus Freed.OM was conceived.</p>
</body>
<h2>Description </h2>
</body>
<p style="font-size:16px;">
The app will create a new digital environment that facilitates the active participation of users in social media platforms without compromising their rights to privacy. Freed.om will provide users with hassle free experiences online, while retaining their anonymity, thereby reducing the amount of data accumulated on individuals. This app’s true originality lies in its approach in the utilization of the technologies of the modern era without causing lasting detrimental effects to the freedom and privacy of every person using them. Irrespective of whether they utilize the app or not,essentially the harvested data will be deemed to be of little value due the vastness of the corrupted data.

 Until the present there haven't been many applications that have taken advantage of the already present cookies and trackers to circumvent and deliberately corrupt the process of data gathering implemented by platforms such as Facebook. This project will create an application that will efficiently and effectively aid and enable end users the freedom to browse, interact and access these resources and maintain a digital presence without having to compromise on their most valuable asset- data and as such this project will truly become an innovative and novel invention.

This project aims to address the missing component that is causing grave concerns for a large section of the society, who wish to explore an alternative to the current practices of social media usage. It must be noted that in a recent survey that was carried out on whether the general user trusts Facebook in keeping their information secure, a  surprisingly phenomenal number of individuals stated that do not trust the platform, that is 47% of Facebook users, who responded that they do not believe the tech giant securely protect their data, while 23% of those who do trust Facebook, only do so “somewhat”. (Hootsuite 2021). With such a staggeringly high rate of distrust, this app will become a significant and necessary alternative.

The functionality of this app will be made possible by creating a portal in which the users allow all communication with social media platforms be directed to their inbox. There they will then activate the plug-in that will provide an automated response to all sign -in queries and location notifications generated by the duplication logins to be confirmed. However this app will closely monitor any communication that references location that was not generated by the app, and will create specific alerts for users to confirm any unusual logins and ensure safety for hacking. Meanwhile an alternate application will run continuous clearing of the local cache so the stored metadata of the user will be harder to gather and thus resulting in an added privacy veil. 


For this project, the app will be in a similar functioning process style to how VPN and TOR combinations of IP-securing work, however with a very different aim and methodology. The key goal will be to retain as much privacy as possible. In order for this app to be created, these essential artifacts will be necessary,  a repository of randomly generated brower routes, making use of TOR’s web traffic anonymisation proxy, while simultaneously making use of a large scale, as well as numerous VPN stimulated connections, in order to generate enough duplications to cause a significant corruption to the data collected will be a minimum requisite.

The general feasibility of this project is limited by the ability to raise the initial investment required, and the continued development of the project is possible by charging users for the services. As the current climate indicates, the growing number of users who utilise the services of paid VPN services have risen and the number of service providers has also increased.(One Zero 2019)
</p>
</body>
<h2>Tools and Technologies </h2>
</body>
<p style="font-size:16px;">

This project will require an app to be developed using either the MIT App Inventor, or will require a member of the group to be significantly skilled in a major developing language with experience in both front end and back end platform development. It will require a TOR relay( CSO Online 2019) to navigate the duplication through different servers. 
It will also require the purchase and maintenance of local servers in at least 10 - 15 locations. Initially, with limited users, these may be done bypassing cloud storage and relying on the device hardware, or multiple external hardwares connected and step up to constantly be running on local devices. Additionally VPN(One Zero 2019) will need to be purchased in order to create quantifiable duplications for each user.  
</p>
</body>
<h2>Skills Required </h2>
</body>
<p style="font-size:16px;">

The project will require individuals from multiple disciplines to collaborate in order to make this project feasible. Initially it will require software developers with prior experience in creating portals, with multiple functionalities, such as but not limited to email storage, automated response implementation, deletion of local cache, operation of duplication sites, notification settings, alerts systems and real time updates. It will require at least a single team member with significant experience in running marketing campaigns and SEO optimisation skills so clients are aware of the product. It will require multiple units of computing hardware as well as portable storage units with high capacities, this will need to be increased to local servers and possibly multiple TOR relay nodes in at least 10 -15 locations globally, or in the markets with the highest usage. It will also require the acquisition of a bulk VPN to further accelerate the duplication processes of social media sites. 
</p>
</body>
<h2>Outcome </h2>
</body>
<p style="font-size:16px;">
If this project were to be implemented, this will undoubtedly change how social media works and also go on to give users the ability to control and ultimately limit the harvesting of data for individuals. It may provide users with the peace of mind and reassurance the current social media platforms have failed to provide.(Hootsuite 2021). As such this App will disrupt the way large platforms work and it  could lead to more conversations and promote legislations that focus priority in maintaining transparency and strict oversight over the usage of  data mining practices. This project will essentially bring about a new age for how the resource of data works, and can be utilised without compromising on individual privacy.</p>
